# sqlite3vfshttp: a Go sqlite VFS for querying databases over http(s)

sqlite3vfshttp is a sqlite3 VFS for querying remote databases over http(s).
This allows you to perform queries without needing to download the complete database
first.

Your database must be hosted on a webserver that supports HTTP range requests (such as Amazon S3).

## Example

See [sqlitehttpcli/sqlitehttpcli.go](sqlitehttpcli/sqlitehttpcli.go) for a simple CLI
tool that is able to query a remotely hosted sqlite database.

## Usage


```
	vfs := sqlite3vfshttp.New(*url)

	err := sqlite3vfs.RegisterVFS("httpvfs", vfs)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("register vfs err: %s", err)
	}

	db, err := sql.Open("sqlite3", "not_a_read_name.db?vfs=httpvfs&mode=ro")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("open db err: %s", err)
	}
```

## Querying a database in S3

The original purpose of this library was to allow an AWS Lambda function to be able to query a sqlite database stored in S3 without downloading the entire database.

This is possible even for private files stored in S3 by generating a presigned URL and passing that to this library. That allows the client to make HTTP Get range requests without it needing to know how to sign S3 requests.


## Demo

I've uploaded a 30MB sqlite database to a publicly accessible webserver for testing, based on "Balance of payments international investment position: March 2021 quarter â€“ CSV" from https://www.stats.govt.nz/large-datasets/csv-files-for-download/. The schema is:

```
CREATE TABLE csv (series_reference,
period,
data_value,
suppressed,
status,
units,
magntude,
subject,
grp,
series_title_1);

```

You can query this dataset using the `sqlitehttpcli` example tool:

```
# query the sqlite schema table
$ ./sqlitehttpcli -url 'https://www.sanford.io/demo.db' -query 'select * from main.sqlite_master'
row: [table csv csv 2 CREATE TABLE csv (series_reference,
period,
data_value,
suppressed,
status,
units,
magntude,
subject,
grp,
series_title_1)]

# get 10 rows from the dataset
./sqlitehttpcli -url 'https://www.sanford.io/demo.db' -query "select * from csv limit 10"
